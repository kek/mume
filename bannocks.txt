A Small, Stony House
This old and stony house is really small. It is mainly a big kitchen, with the
entire northern wall being hidden by the stove. Upon the stove sits a large
kettle emitting a faint whistle. Against the southern wall stands a large
table, covered with big white flour spots. The eastern wall is taken up by a
large bed with a grass mattress. There is nothing against the western wall,
except a stair leading up. The steps are worn out by centuries of heavy feet
slouching up and down them.
